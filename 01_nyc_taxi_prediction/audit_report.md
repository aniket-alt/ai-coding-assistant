# Audit report — NYC Taxi Trip Duration

**Result: PASS** · 0 critical · 0 warnings · 3/3 runtime assertions passed

## Runtime assertions

These executed inside the training script and would have halted it on failure. Each entry is written by the assertion itself, so removing a check removes its evidence.

| Assertion | Result | What it measured |
|---|---|---|
| `assert_temporal_split` | ✅ passed | Last training timestamp 2024-01-24 23:59:55 precedes first test timestamp 2024-01-26 00:00:01 by 1 days 00:00:06; embargo of 12h required. |
| `assert_disjoint` | ✅ passed | 456,487 training and 121,130 test row indices compared; 0 appear in both. |
| `assert_no_target_leak` | ✅ passed | 22 numeric features correlated against the target; strongest was zp_median_distance at |r|=0.7821 (threshold 0.995). |

## Limitations of this audit

- The static pass matches known leakage patterns; it cannot prove the absence of leakage it has no rule for.
- Runtime assertions check what they were written to check: temporal order, disjoint splits, and features near-perfectly correlated with the target. Subtler leakage, such as a feature that is only partly derived from the target, can pass them.
