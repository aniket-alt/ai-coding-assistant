# Audit report — Portfolio Audit

**Result: PASS** · 0 critical · 0 warnings · 3/3 runtime assertions passed

## Runtime assertions

These executed inside the training script and would have halted it on failure. Each entry is written by the assertion itself, so removing a check removes its evidence.

| Assertion | Result | What it measured |
|---|---|---|
| `assert_leaks_differ_from_template` | ✅ passed | 11 leak variants compared with the clean template; 0 identical. |
| `assert_all_variants_executed` | ✅ passed | 14 variants executed; 0 failed for reasons other than a leakage check. |
| `assert_controls_are_clean` | ✅ passed | 3 controls scored within 0.0036 average precision of the template and raised 0 runtime checks. |

## Limitations of this audit

- The static pass matches known leakage patterns; it cannot prove the absence of leakage it has no rule for.
- Runtime assertions check what they were written to check: temporal order, disjoint splits, and features near-perfectly correlated with the target. Subtler leakage, such as a feature that is only partly derived from the target, can pass them.
